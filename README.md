#Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal I was trying to fix was to create an app that counted inventory for the user and to let that user know when an item reaches an on hand of zero. 

#What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I had to make sure that the application used CRUD to crreate and use a database while also using 3 screens to make sure that the user can have and create a login while the second screen shows the inventory in a grid, my designs were successful as I kept it simple while still completing the goals

#How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I started by thinking about every way the app and its code need to connect then I started coding the project and using my notes to make sure that everything was connected and would work correctly.

#How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I used the virtual site that the school provided to make sure that everything worked however this is important as it makes sure that we are putting a working product out to the public and it showed me a few issues to come up while coding as I did miss a few things.

#Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There was a few issues that I came across but I was able to overcome them by looking up the error codes or finding ways around the errors

#In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 

The backend as this was something I was extremely proud of as U feel as though I did an amazing job on it!
